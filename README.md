<h3>Description:</h3>

___
>Ani2Cmd (Animated To Cmd) is a program that gives batch file the ability to play video animation thru the help of external plugins. Video length won't matter as the user can play video longer than one minute except the fact that it'll consume much more time and storage space to convert mp4 to video archive. The animation works by loading image sequence in even pattern. Audio isn't supported due to the issue of synchronizing sound and animation sequence. This program support FFmpeg as external plugin.

# FAQs
>Q1: Why does the animation show unexpected visual line when I play the animation?
<img src=".github\prev4.jpg" width="80%;" height="80%;">

>A1: It occurs because "cmddraw" loads the frame similar to how retro tv work.

<b>Factors that might cause the visual line to appear:</b>

• Video doesn't have film bars.

⇒ Film bars helps to minimize the occurrence of visual line.

• Extremely fast video scene.

⇒ Any video that loads frame quickly will likely trigger the visual line to appear.

• Too many colors.

⇒ If you're to play a scene that consist of colorful background or seizure video it'll probably cause visual line to occur.
